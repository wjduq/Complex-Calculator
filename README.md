# ComplexCalculator

Designed a class named Complex for representing complex numbers and the functions
add, subtract, multiply, divide, abs for performing complex-number operations, and the
toString function for returning a string representation for a complex number. The
toString function returns a string formatted as a + bi if b>0 , a - bi if b<0 and if b is 0, it
simply returns a.

There are three constructors Complex (a, b), Complex(a), and Complex (). Complex ()
creates a Complex object for number 0 and Complex(a) creates a Complex object with 0
for b. The getRealPart () and getImaginaryPart () methods return the
real and imaginary part of the complex number, respectively.

The operators +=, -=, *=, /=, [] ,prefix ++ , postfix ++ are overloaded as member functions.

The operators +, -, *, /, <<, and >> are overloaded as nonmember functions.
